**Technical project**, a simple radar using the ultrasonic sensor to detect objects within the short range.
Radar is an object detection system that uses electromagnetic waves to identify range, altitude, direction, or speed of both moving and fixed objects such as aircraft, ships, vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. When we use ultrasonic waves instead of electromagnetic waves, we call it ultrasonic radar.
In this technical project, where we made a simple radar using the ultrasonic sensor, this radar works by measuring a range from 3cm to 40 cm as non-contact distance, with angle range between 15Àö and 165Àö.The movement of the sensor is controlled by using a small servo motor. Information received from the sensor will be used by ‚ÄúProcessing Development Environment‚Äù software to illustrate the result on a PC screen.
This project was developed as part of a technical showcase and was presented at the **Open House Event** hosted by the Department of CSE at SSIT.

### This model is built for following purpose:
1. Detect the presence of both moving and static objects.

2. Identify and measure range, direction, and relative position from the sensor.

3. Demonstrate radar-like object detection using accessible electronic components.

### Features
1. Real-time object detection and display

2. Angular sweep between 15Àö and 165Àö

3. Radar-like interface via Processing

4. Non-contact range detection (3cm ‚Äì 40cm)

### Tools and Technologies used :
1. Arduino Board UNO Model

2. Processing Software

3. Ultrasonic sensors HC- SR04

4. Servo Motor tower pro micro servo 9g

5. Jump Wires

6. Arduino IDE
