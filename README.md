### About :
Radar is an object detection system that uses electromagnetic waves to identify range, altitude, direction, or speed of both moving and fixed objects such as aircraft, ships, vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. When we use ultrasonic waves instead of electromagnetic waves, we call it ultrasonic radar.
In this technical project, we make a simple radar using the ultrasonic sensor, this radar works by measuring a range from 3cm to 40 cm as non-contact distance, with angle range between 15˚ and 165˚.The movement of the sensor is controlled by using a small servo motor. Information received from the sensor will be used by “Processing Development Environment” software to illustrate the result on a PC screen.
#### This model is built for following purpose:
1. To allow users to detect the presence of both moving and fixed objects.

2. To to identify and measurerange, altitude, direction, or speed of both moving and fixed objects from the target to the observer.

### Tools and Technologies used :
1. Arduino Board UNO Model

2. Processing Software

3. Ultrasonic sensors HC- SR04

4. Servo Motor tower pro micro servo 9g

5. Jump Wires
